 * Enervation (less energy)
 * Toxemia (discomfort, even less energy)
 * Irritation (urgent elimination)
 * Inflammation (pain)
 * Ulceration (cells destroyed)
 * Induration (hard tissue bags)
 * Cancer (cells go crazy)

16,"L’amour envers soi, apprécier vivre avec soi, prendre soin de soi. La confiance en soi pour déterminer ce qui est important pour moi, les responsabilités envers soi pour l’entraînement des pensées, le suivi de mes désirs et l’écoute de mes vérités au moment de faire des choix, l’acceptation de la décision prise, le mélange de la raison et de l’intuition. L’organisation et le respect de mes idées en équilibre avec l’action et le plaisir. Les valeurs de bonté et de gentillesse, de simplicité et d’humilité, de confiance et de courage, de patience et d’amour. La gratitude des moments de la journée et de la beauté côtoyée aujourd’hui. L’apprentissage et la pratique des éléments pour ma croissance personnelle.",G2
