# Development Notes

## Useful Deployment Tips

If not using Github Pages, but a static file server such as Google Cloud Storage,
you may execute the server locally to generate the `_site` folder which contain the generated static files.

Make sure to replace the link to the story page, from `/story` to `/story.html`.

## Story

Ideas to improve story page:

 - Create desktop and mobile assets and display accordingly using PICTURE tag
    to avoid extra download.
 - Add links to view full-scale images.
 - Use a simpler layout on mobile.
 - Support read view on Safari (desktop and mobile).
 - Bring colors into each section instead of grey tones.
 - Use style in *The Web's Grain* article.

Image-specific...

 - Github screenshots could also include:
    diagram of pages and Github features used, 
    overview of other pages such as Logbook and Architecture.
 - For mobile, the Github screenshot should be only a logo with diagram of pages.
 - Add more sketches to support initial sketch. (Collage?)
 - Add screenshots of apps analyzed for the UX research material.
 - Add screenshot of backlog with link to real backlog.
 - Add photos of paper prototype. (Organize flow to be sexier or interactive.)
