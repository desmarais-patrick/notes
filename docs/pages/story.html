        <p>A snowstorm in April. That is the life in Montreal, sometimes. 
            This weather was the reason my flight was delayed. 
            I was on my way back from Chicago, where I visited my friend 
            Guillaume. 
            I sat in the Toronto airport lounge, with time to think. 
            Before leaving for the city of architecture, 
            the idea of moving on to a personal project had already formed. 
            Except this time, I thought, I would finish this personal project, 
            up to its release in production.</p>

        <p>I like sketching.
            Since I completed my degree in software engineering, 
            many app ideas have populated my sketch books. 
            I took notes whenever I thought of an app or 
            concept to solve a problem with technology.
            It could be for helping me automate tracking my expenses, 
            remind me when bills are due, 
            or motivate me to follow healthy habits such as 
            drinking water or training flexibility and mobility. 
            My notebooks were full of ideas; 
            however, my attempts to bring them to reality were not conclusive. 
            In many cases, it required a lot of effort and the design 
            wasn‚Äôt satisfactory. 
            I continued to try, failing and learning. 
            I accumulated enough experience and lessons 
            to try one more time.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>From Chicago to Montreal, 
            the plan to complete a personal project became clearer. 
            I chose the project of note-taking and categorization. 
            A simple endeavour, I thought. 
            Previous attempts often started with a complex solution 
            from the start. It didn‚Äôt work. 
            I wanted to start small in order to complete it. 
            I also wanted to achieve objectives 
            regarding design and programming. 
            For example, here are two objectives for this project:</p>
        
        <ul class="no-bullets">
            <li><b>Design üñåüé®</b><br>
                <i>Test interface sketches using a paper prototype 
                    before starting code.</i><br>
                <span class="secondary">Human-computer interaction was a special class for me, 
                    where I learned a design process centred around the human. 
                    During the course project, 
                    we used various testing methods to confirm our hypothesis. 
                    One of those methods was using a paper prototype, 
                    which I really wanted to revisit and practice.</span></li>
            <li><b>Programming üë®‚Äçüíª</b><br>
                <i>Build a system architecture using layers and 
                    design patterns.</i><br>
                    <span class="secondary">Many projects I‚Äôve worked on already 
                    encompassed the structure when I joined the team. 
                    Hence, I really wanted to experience 
                    creating my own software architecture and 
                    test it out.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>For each objective, 
            a section was reserved in the project 
            <a href="https://github.com/desmarais-patrick/notes/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

        <h2>Objective I: Design</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Practice design was my first goal to tackle.
            My design background had grown a lot in the recent years.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Human-computer interaction class with its 
                human-centred approach</li>
            <li>Numerous sketches of interfaces for app ideas</li>
            <li>Details in the interaction of apps analyzed 
                during development</li>
            <li>Discussions with user experience and user interface designers 
                about the rationale behind their design decisions</li>
            <li>Talks about the various forms of design 
                at the MTL Design Club</li>
            <li>Online courses about design theory and practice using 
                design tools and graphic design terminology</li>
            <li>Short experience as user interface designer 
                for musical experiences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I learned that design gives a direction 
            for the rest of development.
            Good design makes use of the common sense 
            to build around usability and simplicity. 
            It looks for a balance between flexibility and constraint 
            to bring its users in flow with the app. 
            Best practices aren‚Äôt always appropriate, and 
            the best approach often depends on careful considerations. 
            Good design gets out of the way and becomes invisible. 
            I realized while sitting with professionals and scientists 
            that personal work doesn‚Äôt get easier with experience 
            but actually reaches a new level of abstraction. 
            This level opens new discussions to share perspectives on 
            quality and practices, to try on new experiments.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>This note-taking app was my new experiment.
            I divided a plan with the objective of 
            a simple and elegant design.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the problem (or opportunity to improve) 
                following observations</li>
            <li>Sketch potential solutions</li>
            <li>Research existing solutions</li>
            <li>Analyze and re-define desired solution</li>
            <li>Build paper prototype and test</li>
            <li>Design interface and systems overview</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once these steps completed, I would be ready for coding.
            Given I was the first user for this app, 
            I rapidly moved through the first steps, 
            inspired from sketches from previous years.
            The number of note-taking apps is huge, 
            and many with impressive quality. 
            The choice was difficult. 
            Apps under which I looked on more closely, 
            both on mobile and desktop, 
            included <i>Evernote</i>, <i>Google Keep</i>, <i>Apple‚Äôs Notes</i> 
            and <i>Todoist</i>.
            <i>Todoist</i> was a bit different, 
            being first-and-foremost a task-management tool, 
            yet quite novel in its approach to recording everything actionable 
            through its Inbox feature.
            Once the analysis completed, I refined my solution and 
            reached the paper prototype phase.</p>
        <p>The paper prototype test revealed a big flaw.
            While on paper I thought I could cleverly reuse 
            the categorization component to filter the list of notes, 
            but it brought confusion during the test.
            It looked as a good choice, it was simpler than introducing 
            a new component for filtering. 
            However, when running the use cases with 
            the paper prototype, I could see a source of confusion 
            by mixing both edit and view actions of 
            categorization and filtering in the same component. 
            Complex questions about the intent started to pop, 
            a new design iteration seemed necessary.</p>
        
        <!-- TODO Include image of Directions, on the ledge, approaching storm.
            Caption: Incoming! -->

        <p>The paper prototype proved really useful in revealing this flaw, 
            but the idea of doing one more iteration 
            after all the time it took to complete the first one 
            didn‚Äôt fit with the original schedule. 
            I had already used half of three three-week buffer 
            to finish the first part of design. 
            I had a hard decision to make.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section smooth-break">
        <p>At this point in the project, 
            the motivation started to drop, 
            the stress to rise. 
            This design failure also revealed a flaw in my planning. 
            It was no more realistic to build 
            this simple application within the set time frame. 
            My morale was low. 
            Fortunately, keeping in touch with close friends, 
            I found the support to continue, to come back stronger. 
            From words of encouragement to quotes, 
            from social events to positive stories, 
            this support has been the most precious aspect of this project. 
            Sharing what I was going through with them 
            helped me gain back control over what I felt 
            and find the courage to continue this project.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>I took the decision to reduce the scope, 
            remove the feature of categorization and 
            concentrate on note-taking only. 
            I could still meet my objectives for design and programming. 
            I finished the design moving on 
            to the look-and-feel of the interface. 
            I created a mood board, a design system and a digital mockup.</p>

        <!-- TODO Include exported images for mood board, design system and 
            digital mockup.

        <p>The mood board grouped many visual inspirations for this project; 
            an article by Frank Chimero (The Web‚Äôs Grain), 
            the Learn UI design newsletters on fonts and colour contrast, 
            and many images from my Pinterest boards 
            with colourful quotes and scenes. 
            The mood board set the tone for the design system 
            and digital mockup, 
            where I defined the style and components for the interface. 
            Once the layout was arranged with a simple grid, 
            I was ready to jump to the next software development step.</p>

    <div class="section dark">
        <h2>Objective II: Programming</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Practice programming, I was ready for my second objective. 
            Writing code for an application, 
            whether it‚Äôs server or client, or both, 
            this is where lies most of my work experience. 
            I had the chance to be part of awesome teams over the years. 
            I always found motivation in bringing quality to my work and 
            participate in discussions about technology and architecture. 
            I started a few projects with others after work too:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Web server deployment for e-learning experiments</li>
            <li>Native mobile application for healthcare</li>
            <li>Website for the Toyzilla startup</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>From internships to full-time experiences, 
            I learned and experimented with my peers and mentors 
            on software paradigms, code architecture and project methodologies. 
            Finding the right amount of automated tests to make the code robust 
            but also efficient to develop, 
            lightening the architecture to make code adaptable 
            for the long-term but also flexible for changes, 
            estimating the right amount of time 
            for building a new feature or debugging a problem. 
            Over the years, I learned there is very seldom a general rule, 
            as one of my mentor often replied during 
            our weekly tech discussions: ‚Äún-oui‚Äù, 
            which was followed by ‚Äúit depends‚Äù.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>For this project, the idea was to build a Web application, 
            with both server and client counterparts. 
            Hence, I divided four development steps:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Architecture design</li>
            <li>Deployment</li>
            <li>Server coding</li>
            <li>Client coding</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The architecture design was one I was most excited to work on. 
            For many work projects, the architecture design was already set 
            when I joined. 
            This personal project was an opportunity to test what I learned, 
            to bring theory and observation to practice. 
            Hence, I designed a simple, future-oriented architecture 
            with clear separation of concerns for 
            the central application programming interface (API), 
            the data repository and the client interface.</p>

        <!-- TODO Include diagram of system design.
            Caption: Overall system architecture -->

        <p>Following research on the deployment infrastructure, 
            the system architecture was adapted. 
            Development time and efforts, as well as operating costs
            were factors considered in choosing Google Cloud 
            as the infrastructure provider for this simple project.</p>

        <!-- TODO Include image of a traveller reading in his tent under light
            Caption: Learning throughout the journey -->
        
        <p>During API server implementation, 
            I explored in more depth the topics of API design and 
            dependency injection. 
            I defined my API routes and worked on a documentation 
            using the Swagger API online tool. 
            I further defined the modules within the API server 
            and used as few external libraries as possible. 
            I wanted to keep code simple and elegant, 
            to learn with practice 
            and dive deeper into concepts of programming. 
            This experience helped me understand 
            various challenges solved by third-party libraries, 
            libraries used in past projects at work.</p>

        <!-- TODO Include screenshot of Swagger output and Postman results
            Caption: API design and testing -->

        <p>While the features concentrated only on note-taking, 
            the server code foundation took more time than expected to implement. 
            However, the benefit on learning was still considerable, 
            as the objective to grow my skills. 
            I decided to go forward with the approach 
            to build a foundation for the front-end application. 
            I even used a new approach to develop interface components. 
            Each component of the interface were built separately, 
            to review their style under various states, 
            to test their logic in isolation. 
            I brought the design system to life. 
            This development process was quite neat to follow.</p>

    <div class="section smooth-break">
        <p>During development, every week, 
            I had the chance to discuss my progress with friends. 
            This was very motivating. 
            With developers, we discussed testing approaches, 
            architectural decisions, 
            and exchanged tips on estimating work and defining clear goals. 
            With designers, I had a preview of their current personal project 
            and creative process. 
            With many friends, we exchanged on personal growth, 
            as I took a step back to observe my evolution during this project. 
            I enhanced practical skills, built more self-confidence, 
            trained motivation and resilience to stress, 
            learned to establish constraints for creativity, 
            found a new equilibrium with expectations in reality. 
            This personal project highlighted the importance of 
            friends and family in my life, 
            the building of a story with people I love, 
            these people in my life.</p>

            I adjusted scripts for deployment 
            to account for new files and folders. 
            I tested the integration 
            between the interface and the server.

        <p>This project marked my transition between two jobs. 
            I achieved small victories throughout its realization, 
            I checked my supporting objectives one-by-one, 
            flying through design and programming. 
            I tackled motivation storms with help and patience, 
            technical difficulties with success: 
            reaching project completion! 
            This project changed me, 
            and this wasn‚Äôt possible without the support of my friends. 
            In this project, I explored with my own rhythm 
            and took a step back to realize a small dream. 
            Before I go back to the workplace with new skills 
            and a new perspective to share. 
            I‚Äôm ready to converse with new forces 
            and share my experience with friends and family.</p>

            Excerpt from David Whyte‚Äôs Pilgrimage of Work
            It‚Äôs our responsibility to stay in conversation with the forces at work, to keep on life.

            You can do this Pat, we believe in you!

            To learn to stand in a new equilibrium

            Making the best of our day!

            Excerpt from Presentation Zen
            To avoid any mistake stops you from being truly creative.

            When people get frustrated or dissatisfied of the tool they use, they start looking elsewhere for another app. They think this new app will help them solve their note-taking or task-management problem. Maybe no tool will ever solve their problem, as the problem may be deeper into the person, not in the tool they use.
