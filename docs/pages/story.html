            <p>A snowstorm in April. That is the life in Montreal, sometimes. 
                This weather was the reason my flight was delayed. 
                I was on my way back from Chicago, where I visited my friend 
                Guillaume. 
                I sat in the Toronto airport lounge, with time to think. 
                Before leaving for the city of architecture, 
                the idea of moving on to a personal project had already formed. 
                Except this time, I thought, I would finish this personal project, 
                up to its release in production.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section smooth-break">
            <p>I like sketching.
                Since I completed my degree in software engineering, 
                many app ideas have populated my sketch books. 
                I took notes whenever I thought of an app or 
                concept to solve a problem with technology.
                It could be for helping me automate tracking my expenses, 
                remind me when bills are due, 
                or motivate me to follow healthy habits such as 
                drinking water or training flexibility and mobility. 
                My notebooks were full of ideas; 
                however, my attempts to bring them to reality were not conclusive. 
                In many cases, it required a lot of effort and the design 
                wasn‚Äôt satisfactory. 
                I continued to try, failing and learning. 
                I accumulated enough experience and lessons 
                to try one more time.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>From Chicago to Montreal, 
                the plan to complete a personal project became clearer. 
                I chose the project of note-taking and categorization. 
                A simple endeavour, I thought. 
                Previous attempts often started with a complex solution 
                from the start. It didn‚Äôt work. 
                I wanted to start small in order to complete it. 
                I also wanted to achieve objectives 
                regarding design and programming. 
                For example, here were two objectives for this project:</p>
            
            <ul class="no-bullets">
                <li><b>Design üñåüé®</b><br>
                    <i>Test interface sketches using a paper prototype 
                        before starting code.</i><br>
                    <span class="secondary">Human-computer interaction was a special class for me, 
                        where I learned a design process centred around the human. 
                        During the course project, 
                        we used various testing methods to confirm our hypothesis. 
                        One of those methods was using a paper prototype, 
                        which I really wanted to revisit and practice.</span></li>
                <li><b>Programming üë®‚Äçüíª</b><br>
                    <i>Build a system architecture using layers and 
                        design patterns.</i><br>
                        <span class="secondary">Many projects I‚Äôve worked on already 
                        encompassed the structure when I joined the team. 
                        Hence, I really wanted to experience 
                        creating my own software architecture and 
                        test it out.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <p>For each objective, 
                a section was reserved in the project

        <div class="section smooth-break">
            <p>Practice design was my first goal to tackle.
                My design background had grown a lot in the recent years.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Human-computer interaction class with its 
                    human-centred approach</li>
                <li>Numerous sketches of interfaces for app ideas</li>
                <li>Details in the interaction of apps analyzed 
                    during development</li>
                <li>Discussions with user experience and user interface designers 
                    about the rationale behind their design decisions</li>
                <li>Talks about the various forms of design 
                    at the MTL Design Club</li>
                <li>Online courses about design theory and practice using 
                    design tools and graphic design terminology</li>
                <li>Short experience as user interface designer 
                    for musical experiences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I learned that design gives a direction 
                for the rest of development.
                Good design makes use of the common sense 
                to build around usability and simplicity. 
                It looks for a balance between flexibility and constraint 
                to bring its users in flow with the app. 
                Best practices aren‚Äôt always appropriate, and 
                the best approach often depends on careful considerations. 
                Good design gets out of the way and becomes invisible. 
                I realized while sitting with professionals and scientists 
                that personal work doesn‚Äôt get easier with experience 
                but actually reaches a new level of abstraction. 
                This level opens new discussions to share perspectives on 
                quality and practices, to try on new experiments.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>This note-taking app was my new experiment.
                I divided a plan with the objective of 
                a simple and elegant design.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the problem (or opportunity to improve) 
                    following observations</li>
                <li>Sketch potential solutions</li>
                <li>Research existing solutions</li>
                <li>Analyze and re-define desired solution</li>
                <li>Build paper prototype and test</li>
                <li>Design interface and systems overview</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Once these steps completed, I would be ready for coding.
                Given I was the first user for this app, 
                I rapidly moved through the first steps, 
                inspired from sketches from previous years.
                The number of note-taking apps is huge, 
                and many with impressive quality. 
                The choice was difficult. 
                Apps under which I looked on more closely, 
                both on mobile and desktop, 
                included <i>Evernote</i>, <i>Google Keep</i>, <i>Apple‚Äôs Notes</i> 
                and <i>Todoist</i>.
                <i>Todoist</i> was a bit different, 
                being first-and-foremost a task-management tool, 
                yet quite novel in its approach to recording everything actionable 
                through its Inbox feature.
                Once the analysis completed, I refined my solution and 
                reached the paper prototype phase.</p>

            <p>The paper prototype test revealed a big flaw.
                While on paper I thought I could cleverly reuse 
                the categorization component to filter the list of notes, 
                but it brought confusion during the test.
                It looked as a good choice, it was simpler than introducing 
                a new component for filtering. 
                However, when running the use cases with 
                the paper prototype, I could see a source of confusion 
                by mixing both edit and view actions of 
                categorization and filtering in the same component. 
                Complex questions about the intent started to pop, 
                a new design iteration seemed necessary.</p>

            <p>The paper prototype proved really useful in revealing this flaw, 
                but the idea of doing one more iteration 
                after all the time it took to complete the first one 
                didn‚Äôt fit with the original schedule. 
                I had already used half of three three-week buffer 
                to finish the first part of design. 
                I had a hard decision to make.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section smooth-break">
            <p>At this point in the project, 
                the motivation started to drop, 
                the stress to rise. 
                This design failure also revealed a flaw in my planning. 
                It was no more realistic to build 
                this simple application within the set time frame. 
                My morale was low. 
                Fortunately, keeping in touch with close friends, 
                I found the support to continue, to come back stronger. 
                From words of encouragement to quotes, 
                from social events to positive stories, 
                this support has been the most precious aspect of this project. 
                Sharing what I was going through with them 
                helped me gain back control over what I felt 
                and find the courage to continue this project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>I took the decision to reduce the scope, 
                remove the feature of categorization and 
                concentrate on note-taking only. 
                I could still meet my objectives for design and programming. 
                I finished the design moving on 
                to the look-and-feel of the interface. 
                I created a mood board, a design system and a digital mockup.</p>

            <p>The mood board grouped many visual inspirations for this project; 
                an article by Frank Chimero (The Web‚Äôs Grain), 
                the Learn UI design newsletters on fonts and colour contrast, 
                and many images from my Pinterest boards 
                with colourful quotes and scenes. 
                The mood board set the tone for the design system 
                and digital mockup, 
                where I defined the style and components for the interface. 
                Once the layout was arranged with a simple grid, 
                I was ready to jump to the next software development step.</p>

            <h2>Objective II: Programming</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>Practice programming, I was ready for my second objective. 
                Writing code for an application, 
                whether it‚Äôs server or client, or both, 
                this is where lies most of my work experience. 
                I had the chance to be part of awesome teams over the years. 
                I always found motivation in bringing quality to my work and 
                participate in discussions about technology and architecture. 
                I started a few projects with others after work too:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Web server deployment for e-learning experiments</li>
                <li>Native mobile application for healthcare</li>
                <li>Website for the Toyzilla startup</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>From internships to full-time experiences, 
                I learned and experimented with my peers and mentors 
                on software paradigms, code architecture and project methodologies. 
                Finding the right amount of automated tests to make the code robust 
                but also efficient to develop, 
                lightening the architecture to make code adaptable 
                for the long-term but also flexible for changes, 
                estimating the right amount of time 
                for building a new feature or debugging a problem. 
                Over the years, I learned there is very seldom a general rule, 
                as one of my mentor often replied during 
                our weekly tech discussions: ‚Äún-oui‚Äù, 
                which was followed by ‚Äúit depends‚Äù.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>For this project, the idea was to build a Web application, 
                with both server and client counterparts. 
                Hence, I divided four development steps:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Architecture design</li>
                <li>Deployment</li>
                <li>Server coding</li>
                <li>Client coding</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The architecture design was one I was most excited to work on. 
                For many work projects, the architecture design was already set 
                when I joined. 
                This personal project was an opportunity to test what I learned, 
                to bring theory and observation to practice. 
                Hence, I designed a simple, future-oriented architecture 
                with clear separation of concerns for 
                the central application programming interface (API), 
                the data repository and the client interface.</p>

            <p>Following research on the deployment infrastructure, 
                the system architecture was adapted. 
                The development time and efforts, as well as the operating costs
                were the main factors considered when choosing Google Cloud 
                as the infrastructure provider for this simple project.</p>
       
            <p>During API server implementation, 
                I explored in more depth the topics of API design and 
                dependency injection. 
                I defined my API routes and worked on a documentation 
                using the Swagger API online tool. 
                I further defined the modules within the API server 
                and used as few external libraries as possible. 
                I wanted to keep code simple and elegant, 
                to learn with practice 
                and dive deeper into concepts of programming. 
                This experience helped me understand 
                various challenges solved by third-party libraries, 
                libraries used in past projects at work.</p>

            <p>While the features concentrated only on note-taking, 
                the server code foundation took more time than expected to implement. 
                However, the benefit on learning was still considerable, 
                as the objective to grow my skills. 
                I decided to go forward with the approach 
                to build a foundation for the front-end application. 
                I even used a new approach to develop interface components. 
                Each component of the interface were built separately, 
                to review their style under various states, 
                to test their logic in isolation. 
                I brought the design system to life. 
                This development process was quite neat to follow.</p>

            <p>During development, every week, 
                I had the chance to discuss my progress with friends. 
                This was very motivating. 
                With developers, we discussed testing approaches, 
                architectural decisions, 
                and exchanged tips on estimating work and defining clear goals. 
                With designers, we shared our perspectives on graphic design 
                and the creative process. 
                With many friends, we exchanged on personal growth, 
                as I took a step back to observe my evolution during this project. 
                I enhanced practical skills, built more self-confidence, 
                trained motivation and resilience to stress, 
                learned to establish constraints for creativity, 
                found a new equilibrium with expectations in reality. 
                This personal project highlighted the importance of 
                friends and family in my life, 
                the building of a story with people I belong to, 
                these people in my life.</p>

                I adjusted scripts for deployment 
                to account for new files and folders. 
                I tested the integration

            <p>This project marked my transition between two jobs, 
                A little bit like my connecting flight between Chicago and Montreal,
                this project offered time to reflect on two aspects of work as a 
                software developer: design and programming.
                This time is part of this transition between two jobs,
                in which I explored with my own rhythm 
                and took a step back to realize a small dream.
                I completed the release of an app I designed.</p>
            <p>I achieved small victories throughout its realization, 
                I checked my supporting objectives one-by-one, 
                leaving space for questions and further considerations.
                I recorded my work, my hours to be able to see how I work. 
                I tackled motivation storms with help and patience, 
                I tackled technical difficulties with perseverance!</p>
            <p>This project changed me, 
                and this wasn‚Äôt possible without the support of my friends.
                I will now go back to the workplace with new skills 
                and new perspectives on design and programming. 
                I feel ready to converse with new forces at work
                and share some of this experience with friends and family.</p>

                To avoid any mistake stops you from being truly creative.

                When people get frustrated or dissatisfied of the tool they use, they start looking elsewhere for another app. They think this new app will help them solve their note-taking or task-management problem. Maybe no tool will ever solve their problem, as the problem may be deeper into the person, not in the tool they use.
